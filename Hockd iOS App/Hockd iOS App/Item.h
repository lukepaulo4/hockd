//What should loanDesired be? Is there a class that is indicative of what this should be? When thinking of similar applications where you can insert a $$ amount, it usually only allows you to put a number then the text box says $200 or whatever you selected. So maybe there is a special textbox that will only allow a number to be put it, but then that can be read as a string?
